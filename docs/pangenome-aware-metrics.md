# Runtime and accuracy metrics for Pangenome-aware DeepVariant

## WGS (Illumina)

BAM: We used the VG Giraffe mapped BAM file. You can find it in:
`gs://deepvariant/vg-case-study/HG003.novaseq.pcr-free.35x.vg-1.55.0.bam`

### Runtime

Runtime is on HG003 (all chromosomes).
Reported runtime is an average of 5 runs.

Stage                            | Time (minutes)
-------------------------------- | ------------------
make_examples                    | 275m42.01s
call_variants                    | 521m13.57s
postprocess_variants (with gVCF) | 40m1.88s
vcf_stats_report (optional)      | 8m40.68s
total                            | 860m54.66s (14h20m54.66s)

### Accuracy

hap.py results on HG003 (all chromosomes, using NIST v4.2.1 truth), which was
held out while training.

| Type  | TRUTH.TP | TRUTH.FN | QUERY.FP | METRIC.Recall | METRIC.Precision | METRIC.F1_Score |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| INDEL | 502505   | 1996     | 1365     | 0.996044      | 0.997401         | 0.996722        |
| SNP   | 3319173  | 8323     | 4411     | 0.997499      | 0.998674         | 0.998086        |

## How to reproduce the metrics on this page

For simplicity and consistency, we report runtime with a
[CPU instance with 64 CPUs](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform)
This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration.
